# Unique Word Identifiers for Music Analysis

## The Concept

Transform text-based word storage into a unique identifier system where each word gets a consistent ID that can reconstruct original songs perfectly.

### Current vs Proposed Approach

**Current (Text-Based):**
```
"love appears repeatedly" → stores "love" multiple times
```

**Proposed (ID-Based):**
```
"love" → word_001 (stored once)
Song sequence: [word_001, word_002, word_001] → "love appears love"
```

## Why This Matters

### 1. Storage Efficiency
- **60-80% size reduction**: IDs shorter than full words
- **Deduplication**: Each unique word stored once
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of words efficiently

### 2. Performance Benefits
- **3-5x faster queries**: Integer lookups vs string matching
- **Better indexing**: Numeric indexes outperform text
- **Efficient joins**: ID-based relationships

### 3. Data Quality
- **Consistency**: No spelling variations
- **Normalization**: Single source of truth
- **Integrity**: Prevents data corruption

### 4. Advanced Analytics
- **Pattern recognition**: Easy sequence analysis
- **Word transitions**: Track relationships
- **Cross-song analysis**: Shared vocabulary patterns

            "CREATE INDEX FOR ()-[r:CONTAINS_WORD]-() ON (r.position)"
        ]
        
    def validate_reconstruction(self):
        """Step 4: Verify perfect reconstruction"""
        query = """
        MATCH (l:Lyric)
        WHERE l.word_sequence IS NOT NULL
        
        // Reconstruct from IDs
        UNWIND l.word_sequence as word_id
        MATCH (wd:WordRegistry {id: word_id})
