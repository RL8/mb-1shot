Largely serving as a parallel to 2019’s… Read More [Verse 1]\nI have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser\nMidnights become my afternoons\nWhen my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people\nI've ghosted stand there in the room\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI should not be left to my own devices\nThey come with prices and vices\nI end up in crisis\n(Tale as old as time)\nI wake up screaming from dreaming\nOne day, I'll watch as you're leaving\n'Cause you got tired of my scheming\n(For the last time)\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's me, hi\nI'm the problem, it's me\nAt teatime, everybody agrees\nI'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby\nAnd I'm a monster on the hill\nToo big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city\nPierced through the heart, but never killed\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDid you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism\nLike some kind of congressman?\n(A tale as old as time)\nI wake up screaming from dreaming\nOne day, I'll watch as you're leaving\nAnd life will lose all its meaning\n(For the last time)\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's me, hi\nI'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\nAt teatime, everybody agrees\nI'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n\n[Bridge]\nI have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money\nShe thinks I left them in the will\nThe family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out\n\"She's laughing up at us from Hell\"\n\n[Breakdown]\nIt's me, hi\nI'm the problem, it's me\nIt's me, hi\nI'm the problem, it's me\nIt's me, hi\nEverybody agrees, everybody agrees\n\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's me, hi (Hi)\nI'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\nAt teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)\nI'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero",
